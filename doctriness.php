            <b>We believe</b> there is one God, who is infinitely perfect, existing eternally in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
            
                <br><br>

            <b>We believe</b> Jesus Christ is the true God and the true man.
            
                <br><br>

            <b>We believe</b> he died upon the cross, the just for the unjust, as a substitutionary sacrifice, and all who believe in Him are justified on the ground of His shed blood.
            
                <br><br>

            <b>We believe</b> he will come again to establish His kingdom, righteousness and peace. 
            
                <br><br>

            <b>We believe</b> the Holy Spirit is a divine person, sent to indwell, guide, teach, empower the believer, and convince the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment.
            
                <br><br>

            <b>We believe</b> the Old and New Testaments, inerrant as originally given, were verbally inspired by God and are a complete revelation of His will for the salvation of men.
            
                <br><br>

            <b>We believe</b> all men are born with a sinful nature, are separated from the life of God, and can be saved only through the atoning work of the Lord Jesus Christ.
            
                <br><br>

            <b>We believe</b> the portion of the unrepentant and unbelieving is existence forever in conscious torment; and that of the believer, in everlasting joy and bliss.
            
                <br><br>

            <b>We believe</b> salvation has been provided through Jesus Christ for all men; and  those who repent and believe in Him are born again of the Holy Spirit,  receive the gift of eternal life, and become the children of God.
            
                <br><br>

            <b>We believe</b> it is the will of God that each believer should be filled with the Holy Spirit and be sanctified wholly, being separated from sin and the world and fully dedicated to the will  of God, thereby receiving power for holy living and effective service.
            
                <br><br>
 
            <b>We believe</b> provision is made in the redemptive work of the Lord Jesus Christ for the healing of the mortal body.
            
                <br><br>

            <b>We believe</b> the Church consists of all those who believe on the Lord Jesus  Christ, are redeemed through His blood, and are born again of the Holy  Spirit. 
            
                <br><br>

            <b>We believe</b> the local church is a body of believers in Christ who are joined  together for the worship of God, for edification through the Word of  God, for prayer, fellowship, the proclamation of the gospel, and  observance of the ordinances of Baptism and the Lordâ€™s Supper.
            
                <br><br>

            <b>We believe</b> there shall be a bodily resurrection of the just and of the unjust; for the former, a resurrection unto life: for the latter, a resurrection unto judgment.
