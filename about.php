            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>We exist to help a community of people to return to their God by sharing the Good News with them and to help them to primarily love God (Ex. 20:2, Deut. 6:5, Matt. 22:37), next to love one another (John 13:34) and to love the lost and bring them to a loving and saving relationship with Jesus Christ (Luke 19:10)

                <h3>Beliefs</h3>
                <p>We believe that Jesus is the Christ, God incarnate. He came in human form to sacrifice Himself, once for all, that we might not perish but have eternal life. This is the bedrock of our belief-the spiritual DNA of The Alliance. Our family tree bears the fruit of the deeper life, Fourfold Gospel, and the "living out" of Alliance core values-all fueling our  uncompromising call to "go" wherever and whenever God leads.
